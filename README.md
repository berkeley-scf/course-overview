## Overview

This is a GitHub Pages template based on Just the Class, developed for
the purpose of quickly deploying course overview websites. Such websites
link to previous course offerings, provide a summary of what the course
is about, and may list learning goals and prerequisites. This paragraph
would normally be replaced by the description of a specific course, and
could include information from the [Berkeley Academic
Guide](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/).'

After instantiating this template, set the following secrets and variables
in the new repository.

| Type     | Name                 | Value |
